WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY DOCTOR

1. l'
	- l' &+ : how can I get rid of the &+ ??
	- l' &+ metge : bad because l' only goes with vowels
	- wrong form when imperative : vesteix &+ et should be vesteix-te
		-> in ExtraCat.gf in the rgl, the only available pronouns are
		"tu" "et" "et" "tu" (so, we're missing '-te', which is used
		when the pronoun is used after the verb -for imperatives-,
		therefore the Doctor won't work perfectly)

2. ser/estar
	- should be made with estar but aren't:
		- bepregnantproperty
		- beillproperty
		- bewellproperty
	- should be made with ser but aren't:
		- all of the places (home, hospital, school, work) -> actually
            people also use estar for these but the most genuine way
            is with ser, so if this can't be fixed it's not the end of
            the world.
	- are made with estar but shouldn't be made at all (???):
		- estat, menjat, prengut (prÃ¨s), respirat, tossit, vomitat,
            anat, dormit (if anything, should be adormit), examinat,
            medit, quedat, tingut -> many of these could work with
            the verb haver "ha menjat (he/she has eaten)" etc.
